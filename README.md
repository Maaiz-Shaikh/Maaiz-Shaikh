I'm a software engineer passionate about building **AI-powered automation**, creating solutions that simplify complex processes, and developing technology that empowers people. Some technologies I enjoy working with include **Python, Django, Streamlit, and RAG**.  

I focus on **machine learning, natural language processing, and intelligent automation**, and love turning ideas into **production-ready applications**.
