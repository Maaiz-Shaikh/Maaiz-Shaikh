I'm a software engineer passionate about building **AI-powered automation**, creating solutions that simplify complex processes, and developing technology that empowers people. I focus on **machine learning, natural language processing, and intelligent automation**, and love turning ideas into production-ready applications.  

Some technologies and frameworks I enjoy working with include **Python, Django, Streamlit, LangChain, Haystack, HuggingFace Transformers, PGVector, FAISS, Redis, Docker, and OpenSearch**.  

🚀 I specialize in building **end-to-end Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) pipelines** using vector databases, hybrid retrieval (dense + sparse), and optimized context strategies.  
🧠 Experienced in **fine-tuning LLMs**, designing prompt frameworks, and deploying real-world GenAI systems.  
🛠️ Hands-on experience in building and deploying **containerized AI applications** using Docker on AWS EC2.  
🌐 Previously built **full-stack Django applications**.  
🎯 Strong foundation in **algorithms, data structures, and scalable system design**.
